# Multiclass-Text-Classification


Attempted Multiclass-Text classification. Done on "DBPedia Ontology Classification Dataset". 
The classification was done using two machine learning models namely Randon Forests and Linear SVM

The dataset was found to be a balanced dataset and thus did not require any further preprocessing techniques. All the stop words were eliminatd.

The vocabulary of both test and train datasets is assumed to be same.
